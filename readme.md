A small web component used across my mockup sites as notice that it is a mockup site.
This readme is here in case I forgot how to use this gimmick.

It doubles or is similar to an anchor tag `<a>` where it accepts a `href` attribute as a link, and the inner HTML content (preferable just a string) is the text which the link links to.

Confusing?

Just remember, **it doubles as a an anchor tag**, the rest will fall into place.
