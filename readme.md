A small web component used across my mockup sites as notice that it is a mockup site.
This readme is here in case I forgot how to use this gimmick.

It doubles as an anchor tag. <br>
`href` attribute sets the link to the given value of this property.
Like the `href` of an`<a>` tag. <br>
`label` attribute sets the label of the link given value of this property.
Like the innerHTML of an`<a>` tag. <br>
The innerHTML of this is a `<slot>` of an extra description if any.
